    <h3>The following are the terms and conditions for the use of RFPGurus services on your account. Please read them carefully. Access to or use of this site from territories where its contents are illegal is prohibited.</h3>

    <h2>1. RFPGurus Services</h2>
    <p>Upon acceptance, full completion of a User’s registration, and payment of membership fees, RFPGurus shall provide to such User the VendorLine Services, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.</p>
    <p><strong>a.</strong> Services shall include the following: <strong>1)</strong> access to and use of the VendorLine website and RFPGurus Vendor Portals, <strong>2)</strong> access to the Account Manager which includes the tools to register with available PB System™ Agencies and maintain common profile questions as defined by RFPGurus, <strong>3)</strong> searching for Bid postings in all stages including but not limited to planning, bidding, closed, award pending, awarded, cancelled, or rejected from potential Agencies within available search criteria, <strong>4)</strong> receiving the “VendorLine Today” report via email of matched bids based on our selected notification criteria, <strong>5)</strong> listing of your User profile contact information or website links, as applicable, for the purpose of greater product or service offerings to other VendorLine Users, and <strong>6)</strong> access to News and Events listed from Agencies and VendorLine related announcements and events.</p>
    <p><strong>b.</strong> RFPGurus may add new products and services or make improvements and/or amendments to the website at any time. Any and all relevant portions of these terms and conditions will automatically apply to all new products, services, improvements and/or amendments as they appear. RFPGurus does not guarantee that use of the Services will produce any sales leads, quotes, business opportunities or other information helpful to the business of User.</p>
    <p><strong>c.</strong> RFPGurus does not warrant those Bid submittals or other transmissions of information have been completed until an email confirmation of the transmission has been issued by RFPGurus. It is the responsibility of the user to confirm all transmissions of information and the user hereby waives any claim against RFPGurus for bid transmissions, failures, or delays.</p>
    <p><strong>d.</strong> Software, interface to and availability of the Internet and the related equipment by their nature, are not fault tolerant, but RFPGurus will use reasonable efforts to make the Services available 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, except for downtime for scheduled and unscheduled maintenance, and will promptly investigate any technical problems that User reports to RFPGurus.</p>
    <p><strong>e.</strong> In no event can more than one User utilize the Service under the same account at the same time.</p>
    <p><strong>f.</strong> RFPGurus is not responsible for the content and/or transactions conducted online through the services; it is a facilitation service only. Notwithstanding the foregoing, RFPGurus reserves the right to monitor content on the website and to remove content which RFPGurus, in its sole discretion, determines to be offensive, harmful or otherwise in violation of its operating policies and terminate access of the offending User.</p>
    <h2>2. User Registration</h2>
    <p>Registered Vendors, Suppliers or Contractors (“Users”) of the RFPGurus Services, must be 18 years of age or older and must have submitted a completed RFPGurus registration form for the Services. By registering as a User, you represent and warrant <strong>(a)</strong> the information provided is current, complete and accurate, <strong>(b)</strong> that you are authorized to bind the registered entity, and <strong>(c)</strong> you will update the information (including credit card information, if applicable) as required to keep the registration information current, complete and accurate. RFPGurus may reject a submitted registration if it deems, in its sole discretion, such party not to be an appropriate user of the Services. Further, RFPurus may, in its sole discretion, cancel or terminate access to a User it believes has willfully violated the User’s obligations described in this Agreement.</p>
    <h2>3. User Responsibility</h2>
    <p><strong>a.</strong> It is the responsibility of the user to assure that any transmission using the service is received by the intended recipient. User acknowledges that <strong>(1)</strong> RFPGurus does not own or control the User internet interface, the interface to the Buyer’s site, or connectivity to and from RFPGurus’ Services or the Internet, and <strong>(2)</strong> RFPGurus exercises no control over, and has no responsibility for, any content or data transmitted or maintained using the Services nor the information or material accessible upon, or actions taken on, the Buyer’s site or the Internet; and RFPGurus expressly disclaims any liability arising therefrom.</p>
    <p><strong>b.</strong> It is also the responsibility of the user to verify on the list of all current bid supplemental information prior to bid submission. In other words, a final review of the data contained under the Bid Information, Line Items, Documents/Attachments, Addenda &amp; emails, and Q&A tabs should be made immediately prior to Bid submittal. As a courtesy, RFPGurus provides email notification of such changes and supplemental information, but RFPGurus is not responsible for the failure, for any reason, of the User to receive such notices.</p>
    <p><strong>c.</strong> Each User agrees to comply with all applicable laws, ordinances and regulations related to the use of Services and not make any unauthorized commercial use of the Services or of the RFPGurus name, marks or logos. Further, User agrees to not <strong>(a)</strong> transmit information under a false name; <strong>(b)</strong> post any unlawful, threatening, abusive, harassing, libelous, defamatory, obscene, pornographic, profane or otherwise objectionable information of any kind.</p>
    <p><strong>d.</strong> In addition, User agrees to use the Service and the information obtained through the Services only as necessary to complete transaction contemplated by the Service.</p>
    <p><strong>e.</strong> The services are provided “as is.” RFPGurus makes no warranties, express or implied, including without limitation, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual property or other violation of rights, even if RFPGurus has been made aware in advance of such potential risk. Further, RFPGurus does not warrant or make any representations regarding the accuracy, likely results, or reliability of the sites linked thereto, including the buyer’s site.</p>
    <h2>4. Fees and Payments</h2>
    <p><strong>a.</strong> VendorLine Membership Fee: There is an annual subscription fee per year to be a VendorLine member. Membership fees are listed on the VendorLine website and Payment Options section of registration.</p>
    <p><strong>b.</strong> Payment. Fees are due and payable upon membership registration and shall be paid in accordance with the payment method set forth in the membership registration accepted by RFPGurus.</p>
    <p><strong>c.</strong> Fee Changes. RFPGurus reserves the right to change the foregoing Subscription or Membership Renewal fees upon 10 days’ notice posted on the VendorLine website. In the future, fees may vary according to the Membership types or Renewal periods and will be clearly indicated so that the user may review such fees before becoming or renewing their Membership.</p>
    <p><strong>d.</strong> Auto Renewal. As a VendorLine Member, you will have the option to enable the “Auto Renew” feature in “My Account” to avoid lapse or interruption of Services.</p>
    <p><strong>e.</strong> Refund Fee. There is no refund upon cancellation of a VendorLine Membership.</p>
    <h2>5. Confidentiality</h2>
    <p>All correspondence of User related to a particular bid may be delivered to the Buyer at Buyer’s request, without further consent of User. RFPGurus will take reasonable measures not to disclose website communications or information about Users to any other person or entity, except to the extent that RFPGurus believes in good faith that such action is within the scope of the Services or reasonably necessary to <strong>(a)</strong> comply with the law or the directives of courts or governmental agencies; <strong>(b)</strong> enforce this Agreement; <strong>(c)</strong> respond to claims of any third party; or <strong>(d)</strong> protect the legitimate interests of RFPGurus or its Users. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all communications directed to RFPGurus via the website such as questions, comments, inquiries, shall be deemed to be not confidential, unless specifically agreed otherwise in advance by RFPGurus. Further, RFPGurus will have the right to use any User’s name in connection with the advertising or promotion of the Services.</p>
    <h2>6. Security</h2>
    <p>The RFPGurus ordering process is protected by the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol, which encrypts the information and confirms the identity of the RFPGurus server before allowing a transaction to be completed. Internet Explorer 8.0+ (or better), or equivalent product, that supports the SSL protocol are acceptable, but we recommend that Users utilize the latest browsers to ensure that they are protected by advances in security technology. For more detailed information, please refer to the <a routerLink="/privacy-policy"> RFPGurus Privacy Policy.</a></p>
    <p><strong>a.</strong> Password-protection techniques will be provided to restrict access under User’s account to authorized individuals. User acknowledges, however, that access restrictions, by their nature, are capable of the bypass and RFPGurus does not guarantee that the services cannot be accessed by unauthorized persons. User shall at all times maintain as confidential its credentials. If User is a corporation or other business entity, then it may allow employees to use its credentials, but the User shall be responsible for all acts of its employees and for limiting the use of the Services to one person at a time. Permitting third parties to use the Services is prohibited and a violation of this Agreement.</p>
    <p><strong>b.</strong> If a security breach occurs with respect to any account, the Member must immediately change its password and notify RFPGurus at <u>RFPGurus@gmail.com</u>. User shall be liable for any unauthorized use of the Services until RFPGurus is notified of the security breach.</p>
